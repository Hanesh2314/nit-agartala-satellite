Diagnosis
The build failed due to TypeScript errors in the Vite project. The errors are related to missing modules and type declarations in various files of the project.

Solution
To address TypeScript errors like "Cannot find module" or "no exported member named", make sure that the referenced modules and types are correctly imported and declared in the respective files.

Specifically for the missing module "@/types", ensure that the type declarations are present in the repository or installed as a package. Verify the file types/index.d.ts or similar exists in the project directory. If not, check if it needs to be restored or included from a specific source.

For the build script failure with exit code 2, run the following steps:

Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed by running npm install inside the client directory.
Check and fix any TypeScript errors reported in the build log.
Once the TypeScript errors are resolved, rebuild the project using npm run build.
After addressing the TypeScript errors, commit the changes to trigger a new build on Netlify and verify if the build is successful.

If the issue persists, consider updating the TypeScript version or Vite configuration based on the project requirements.

For more information on managing dependencies and Node.js versions in Netlify builds, refer to the documentation for changing Node versions.
